# Governance

## Purpose
This repository defines the guiding principles of PathOps.
The project should remain aligned with these documents over time.

## Changes via PR
All changes to these documents happen via pull requests.

### Expectations
A PR should include:
- the proposed edits
- rationale
- examples if the change affects interpretation
- a note on compatibility (does it change direction or clarify wording?)

## Versioning
Documents are versioned by Git history.
Major shifts should include a short “Why now” section in the PR description.

## Decision-making
- In early stages: maintainer-driven decisions.
- Over time: community feedback via issues and PRs.

## Scope
This repo contains:
- manifesto and principles
- project boundaries
- glossary and governance

It does not contain:
- product docs
- implementation details
- code architecture (those live in the code repos)
