# Decisions

This directory contains **architectural and product decisions** for PathOps.

These documents exist to:
- preserve reasoning over time
- avoid re-litigating resolved questions
- make the project understandable without chat history

They are intentionally lightweight.
This is not enterprise ADR ceremony.

## When to write a decision

Write a decision when:
- a naming choice is finalized
- a model boundary is fixed
- an alternative is explicitly rejected
- changing it later would be costly

If you say:
> “We already discussed this”

That discussion belongs here.

## Naming

Files are numbered in order of creation:

0001-short-description.md


Numbers are chronological, not hierarchical.

## Authority

The content of these files is the **source of truth**.
Chats are not.
