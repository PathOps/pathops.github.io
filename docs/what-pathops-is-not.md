# What PathOps Is NOT

## PathOps is NOT an AI coding assistant
PathOps does not compete with tools that write code.
Those tools generate changes.
**PathOps governs whether those changes are allowed to ship.**

## PathOps is NOT a replacement for CI/CD
PathOps does not replace Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Argo CD.
It coordinates them and interprets outcomes.

## PathOps is NOT a generic “do-anything” platform
PathOps is opinionated by design.
It offers a small set of golden paths that are proven to work.

## PathOps is NOT a black box
PathOps does not silently patch production.
It produces pull requests, evidence, and auditable decisions.

## PathOps is NOT “just ChatOps”
Chat is an interface.
PathOps is a control plane, a state machine, and a set of enforced workflows.

## PathOps is NOT a replacement for human judgment
Humans decide what merges and what promotes.
PathOps ensures decisions are informed, safe, and reversible.

## PathOps is NOT magic
It cannot fix missing tests, poor architecture, or unclear ownership.
PathOps exposes reality; it does not invent it.

## PathOps is NOT designed for uncontrolled parallelism
PathOps supports concurrency only when it can be governed.
Speed without coordination is not a feature.
