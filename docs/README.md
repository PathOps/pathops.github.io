# PathOps Documents

This repository contains the guiding documents for **PathOps**.

- The manifesto and principles define *why PathOps exists* and *what it optimizes for*.
- These documents are versioned, reviewed via pull requests, and intended to be referenced by:
  - the main code repositories
  - the website (manifesto.pathops.io)
  - community discussions

## Documents

- **[manifesto.md](./manifesto.md)** — the “why” and the core promise
- **[principles.md](./principles.md)** — non-negotiable design 
principles
- **[architecture.md](./architecture.md)** — conceptual model + modular implementation map
- **[change-sets.md](./change-sets.md)** — how PathOps governs project-level changes, including human-authored and opaque workflows
- **[artifact-states.md](./artifact-states.md)** — PathOps distinguishes between different states of a software artifact
- **[golden-path-autopilot-flow.md](./golden-path-autopilot-flow.md)** — This document describes the Golden Path autopilot workflow for the demo
- **[golden-path-demo-topology.md](./golden-path-demo-topology.md)** — This document defines the **demo topology** for PathOps and the minimal set of external tools required for the Golden Path demo
- **[integrations.md](integrations.md)** — PathOps integrates with external tools to govern change,
but it does not replace them
- **[multi-tenancy-demo.md](./multi-tenancy-demo.md)** — This document describes **demo-only implementation details**
- **[what-pathops-is-not.md](./what-pathops-is-not.md)** — boundaries and anti-goals
- **[glossary.md](./glossary.md)** — shared terminology
- **[governance.md](./governance.md)** — how these docs evolve
- **[security.md](./security.md)** — security posture for the project and ecosystem
